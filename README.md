TEC-1 Printer Plotter Driver

The process of accessing and communicating with a printer/plotter using codes, specifically ASCII codes. the printer chip creates the shape of the characters based on the codes received from the computer and that the printer/plotter can also be instructed to rotate, plot, vary the size of characters and move in different directions. The data is sent to the printer in bursts and temporarily stored in a FIFO register, allowing larger computers to execute other tasks while the data is being printed. this process is standard and works with any computer that has a normal keyboard.
